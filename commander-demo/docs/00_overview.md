# Overview

## Commander Demo

This document provides a high-level overview of the Commander Demo project.

## Purpose

Commander Demo is a demonstration platform for robot command orchestration using natural language interfaces and LLM-powered decision making.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Commands**: Issue commands in plain English
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Control multiple robotic platforms
- **Real-time Simulation**: MuJoCo-based physics simulation
- **Safety Constraints**: Built-in safety validation layer
- **Playbook System**: Pre-defined operational sequences

## Components

1. **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**
   - REST API and WebSocket endpoints
   - LLM integration via Gemini
   - Simulation engine
   - Safety constraint validation

2. **Frontend (React/TypeScript)**
   - Chat-based command interface
   - Real-time visualization
   - Platform status monitoring

## Getting Started

See the main [README.md](../README.md) for setup instructions.
